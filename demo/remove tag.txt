â€¢	Consider a scenario where you have a script which writes some output to a file. But you accidentally ran that script twice, so your output file contains duplicate entries. Write a script to extract the duplicate entries from that file.

root@Jayasri:~# cat socks.txt
small socks.
Big socks.
Even in between socks.
Orange socks.
Blue socks.
Big socks.
Orange socks.
Blue socks.
As long as they are
new socks.

Output:
root@Jayasri:~# awk '!a[$0]++' socks.txt
small socks.
Big socks.
Even in between socks.
Orange socks.
Blue socks.
As long as they are
new socks.
